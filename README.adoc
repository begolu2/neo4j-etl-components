== Quick Build Instructions

To run the command line tool, once you cloned the project, build the project locally.

From the root directory, run:

----
git clone https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-etl-components
cd neo4j-etl-components
mvn clean package -DskipTests
----

Once that has been successfully executed, the scripts are located in the `neo-etl-cli/bin` directory.

== Issues & Feedback & Contributions

* You can raise link:issues[GitHub issues] or send feedback to feedback@neo4j.com
* Please also join our http://neo4j.com/slack[neo4j-users Slack] and ask in the  #help-import channel

We're welcoming all contributions.

* Please first raise an issue so that we can discuss your ideas and avoid duplicate work
* Send your changes as a pull request 
* Make sure to provide tests with your changes

== Prerequisites

* https://maven.apache.org/[Maven]
* https://www.mysql.com/[MySql]

== Integration Tests

You can run the tests with 

* a local MySQL instance, 
* https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant]
* or in AWS.

You will need a MySQL user `neo4j` with password `neo4j` with admin privileges to run the tests.

To run the tests in AWS, you'll need an AWS IAM user.

To run the tests using a local MySQL instance:

.Grant all privileges to the user `neo4j` identified by password `neo4j`
----
CREATE USER 'neo4j'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'neo4j';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'neo4j'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
----

`mvn -DPLATFORM=local clean integration-test`

To run the tests using Vagrant:

`mvn -DPLATFORM=vagrant clean integration-test`

To run the tests using AWS:

Note: You need to create AWS Keypair and have the credentials file created to do this

`mvn -DPLATFORM=aws -DEC2_SSH_KEY=<name of your EC2 SSH key> clean integration-test`

If you don't supply a `PLATFORM` parameter, the tests will attempt to use Vagrant.

== Performance Tests

Set of tests that are part of the `neo4j-etl-it` module.

However, they are skipped usually when you run the integration-test target by default. You can run them separately as part of a test suite.

To run performance tests in AWS:

`mvn clean dependency:copy-dependencies integration-test -Dtest=PerformanceTestSuite -DfailIfNoTests=false -DPLATFORM=aws -DEC2_SSH_KEY=<name of your EC2 SSH key>`

To run performance tests locally,

Ensure that you have the datasets imported in your local mysql instance. 
You could do this by uncommenting the bits in the code to download the sql file from S3.

`mvn clean dependency:copy-dependencies integration-test -Dtest=PerformanceTestSuite -DfailIfNoTests=false -DPLATFORM=local`
