= Neo4j ETL Components

== Overview 

The Neo4j ETL components, especially the `neo4j-etl` tool, can be used to import well modeled (i.e. normalized) relational data into Neo4j.
It applies some simple rules for transforming the relational model.

The process as outlined below:

1. Read database metadata and generate mapping.json
2. Optionally edit mapping.json
3. Export relational data to CSV
4. Generate Mapping Headers
5. Import into Neo4j using the bulk `neo4j-import` tool

=== What it is

* Command-Line tools 
* Java API/library
* Infer Schema to mapping file
* Filter and merge strategies
* Describe indexes
* Non-trivial datatypes (dates, binary)
* Read mapping file to export data from other databases then
* Import into Neo via Neo4j Import Tool
* Build indexes
* Non-trivial datatypes (dates, binary)
* Support on Linux
* Support MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle
* Support user specified JDBC drivers

=== Plans for the Future

* UI tool to modify mappings - currently manual editing
* Custom Mapping Rules +
 Transformations for names, data, links
* Online Synchronisation, Import into existing database - currently, only supporting initial import
* Exemplary integration into a 3rd party ETL pipeline

=== Who is it for

* Developer learning or playing with Neo4j for initial data import
* Partners providing data integration with Neo4j
* Enterprise developers building applications based on well modeled relational data

=== Open Questions

* Date and binary datatypes
* Security (secure connections, handling of passwords, encrypting data?)

== Capabilities

=== Inferring Schema with Mapping Rules (generate-metadata-mapping)

* Generic { MySql | PostgreSQL | Oracle } database mapping based on the following rules
* A _table_ with a foreign key is treated as a _Join_ and imported as a _node_ with a _relationship_
* Ex: `*Person* -> Address` is imported as `*(Person)-[:ADDRESS_ID]->*(Address)`
* A _table_ that has two foreign keys is imported as a _JoinTable_ and imported as a _relationship_
* Ex: `Student <- *Student_Course* -> Course` is imported as  +
`(Student) -[*:STUDENT_COURSE*]-> (Course)`
* A _table_ that has more than two foreign keys is treated as an _intermediate node_ and imported as _node with multiple relationships_
* Ex: `*Order_Detail* -> Shipping_Address, *Order_Detail* -> Payment_Information, *Order_Detail* -> Shipment_Instructions` is imported as, +
 `(Shipping_Address) *-[:SHIPPING]-> (Order_Detail)*` +
 `(Payment_Information) *-[:PAYMENT]-> (Order_Detail)*` +
 `(Shipment_Instructions) *-[:SHIPMENT]-> (Order_Detail)*` +


* Resolve relationships through composite keys.
* Support most of the data types.
** _TinyInt_ can be imported as either _Byte_ or as a _Boolean_ _(This is to support boolean values being saved in mysql as TinyInt)_
** _Dates_ are imported as _String_
** _Blobs_ are skipped while importing until the import-tool supports binary array data.
** _Decimal to be confirmed._

* Relationship names can either take _column name_ or the _table that is being referred to_
** `--relationship-name=table` then a `Person->Address` will become `(Person)-[*:ADDRESS*]->(Address)`
** `--relationship-name=column` will become `(Person)-[*:ADDRESS_ID*]->(Address)`

* Filter tables that you want to include or exclude using `--include` and `--exclude`

* TODO: Filter columns that you want to include or exclude using `--include` and `--exclude`

* TODO: Retaining natural keys(marked as PrimaryKeys and ForeignKeys) as needed using <TBA> flag
** A Foreign Key is usually used to create a relationship between 2 nodes without being saved as a property. 
** With this flag, the node would keep that value as a property. 
** Ex: A loan has the SSN of the loan applicant which would normally be used to connect the `Loan` and `Person` nodes. 
** With this flag the `Loan` node will also keep the `SSN` as a property.

=== Exporting Data (export)

* Generate CSV files from relational source as outlined by `mappings.json` 
** TODO: Use a streaming api that is more performant
* Import CSV using `neo4j-import` providing the correct labels and rel-types and headers headers

* TODO: Build indexes automatically as part of import
* TODO: Missing ability to pass options to `neo4j-import` tool as a file instead of command line arguments
